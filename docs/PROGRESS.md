# Progress log

## Current status

Milestone 1 (Foundation) is complete and in review as a PR to `main`. Next: milestone 2 (Ratings).

## Known legacy issues (do not rebuild)

These are bugs and dead ends found in `legacy/beat-the-beasts.jsx` during planning. The new game must not reproduce them. Line numbers refer to the legacy file.

| # | Legacy issue | Where | What the new game does instead |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Daily Auto-Draft guarantees a win.** Auto-Draft is shown in the Daily and loads `daily.perfect`, which matches a `topLineups` entry and sets `forceWin`: a one-click guaranteed win. It also silently throws away picks already made, in every mode | `GameScreen` 9193–9233, `handleRunSim` 9150–9184 | No Auto-Draft in the Daily. No `forceWin` in played games. Auto-Draft (Classic, Film Room, Quick Play) keeps picks already made (GDD §6.2, §15 D3/D8) |
| L2 | **Share Results probably crashes.** `RecapModal` portals with `ReactDOM.createPortal`, but `ReactDOM` is never imported (line 1 imports only React). The card also shows the QB's career passer rating as "QB RATING" (a stat leak in Film Room and Daily), uses today's date instead of the Daily's date, and lists only 4 of the 9 players | `RecapModal` 8610–8750 | A share card rebuilt from scratch: this game's QB line, the Daily's date key, the full lineup (GDD §14) |
| L3 | **The skin-tone editor is unreachable.** `HomeScreen` receives `onOpenEditor` but never renders a button, so `CharacterizationEditor` can't be opened, and `skinHexFor` always returns the default `#b07a4a`. It also stored data in a Claude-artifact API (`window.storage`) rather than anywhere durable | `HomeScreen` 5513, `CharacterizationEditor` 9549, `skinHexFor` 6749 | The editor is carried over, reachable from Settings → Gameplay → Skin-tone editor, and saves to `data/characterization.json` in the repo |
| L4 | "New Beasts" (reveal) and "Face New Beasts" (results) both just go to the home menu | 6449, 8320 | Buttons do what they say |
| L5 | Daily: a round with no legal pick (possible through the duplicate-name rule) has no way out, because skips are hidden in the Daily | `spinSlot` 9053 | A deterministic backup pair from the date seed (GDD §6.1 rule 8) |
| L6 | The duplicate-player rule compares names, so homonyms block each other (for example, three different Mike Williamses) | `getAvailablePicks` 4087 | Person ids (GDD §15 D9) |
| L7 | Film Room and Daily leak information: OL unit blurbs, Beast stats with a hidden "*" footnote, post-game career-stat popups | `PickCard` 5740, `BeastChip` 6285 | Explicit Film Room rules (GDD §15 D11) |
| L8 | Captions can print "null" ("Intercepted by null!") when the sim has no named player | `simulateBeatdown` 5196–5216, `captionFor` 8246 | Caption bank with a fallback for every slot |
| L9 | The Beasts' score is sprinkled randomly across the cinematic timeline, and a 1-point remainder is labeled a field goal | 5326–5384 | Per-possession Beasts results (GDD §7.3) |
| L10 | The slot-tile decade label shows "19'" / "20'" instead of "70'" | 9479 | New UI |
| L11 | The key matchup verdict is hardcoded "WR WON / CB WON" even for TE and safety matchups | `ResultScreen` | "REC WON / DEF WON / EVEN" |
| L12 | Dead code: `YearWheelScreen` and `simulateSeason` (season mode), `WindChip`, `ProgressDots`, `ScoreBoard`, `ClockPanel`, `DnDPill`, `TEAM_COLORS` (never called), the whole Odds Lab | various | Not ported. `TEAM_COLORS` is used for draft accents; the drive strip is revived in the HUD |
| L13 | `todayKey` uses the player's local date | 4606 | Kept on purpose (Wordle-style: the daily flips at local midnight) |

## Milestone log

### M1 Foundation (done, PR open for review)

**What's in**

- **Project:** Vite 8 + React 19 + TypeScript 6 (strict), ESLint with purity rules (`src/engine` and `src/sim` can't import React, three or DOM, and can't use `Math.random`, `Date` or `performance.now`), Vitest, Playwright, `CLAUDE.md`, `CREDITS.md`.
- **Data:**
  - `npm run extract` parses the legacy file and writes typed modules to `data/legacy/`, byte-identical values, one entry per line.
  - Ids are stable, frozen in `ids.json`.
  - `UNITS` is split into 184 OL units and 71 DEF units.
  - A drift test checks counts, SHA-256 per dataset, and 60 entries field by field.
  - `docs/DATA_VALIDATION.md` reports every schema mismatch, impossible value, duplicate and homonym found (the brief's audit list plus Ron Howard's WR fields and the four defenders duplicated as RB filler rows).
- **Engine:**
  - A line-for-line port of the legacy rating, Beasts, daily and sim functions, the grade functions and the caption and analysis text generators.
  - Proven **deep-equal to the original file** (loaded straight from `legacy/` at test time) over 5,000 seeded rosters and every daily of 2026.
  - Also: seeded RNG streams, fdlibm-derived deterministic math, and the nickel/dime sub package (+1 CB, +1 S) drawn after the legacy base 11 without changing it.
- **The scene (first pass):** Blackcliff at golden hour.
  - A physically based atmosphere (single scattering, ozone) baked into a sky LUT that drives the sky, the aerial perspective on every material, the ocean reflections and the IBL.
  - A Gerstner ocean with a sun glint path, depth-tinted shallows and shoreline foam.
  - Cliff terrain with triplanar fractured rock and boulders; distant headlands in the haze.
  - The stadium bowl at final proportions: two tiers, club glass, roof, light banks, video board, south masts, open end with terrace.
  - The field shader: mowing stripes with view-dependent sheen, analytic lines and hashes, painted numbers, end zones and the midfield claw.
  - Post chain: N8AO, bloom, AgX plus a per-preset grade and vignette, SMAA.
  - Five lighting presets (Golden Hour tuned; Night, Overcast, Rain and Snow as first passes).
  - A 150-second title flyover and per-menu camera shots.
- **Front end:**
  - Studio intro, then "Press any key" (requests fullscreen, unlocks audio), then the main menu with a live Daily preview (today's Beasts and threat level from the ported engine).
  - Settings: Display, Graphics, Controls with per-context keyboard and gamepad rebinding and conflict moves, Audio, Gameplay, Accessibility.
  - How to Play reference pages, and the skin-tone editor (Settings → Gameplay).
  - Toasts for modes that arrive in later milestones, and the phone/tablet gate plus a no-WebGL2 screen.
- **Input:** an action map with contexts (GDD §8 defaults), keyboard, mouse and gamepad (standard mapping, stick repeat), Keyboard Lock in fullscreen on Chromium, and browser shortcuts captured (context menu, Space/arrow scroll, Backspace, Tab, F1–F3, ctrl+wheel zoom).
- **Audio:** a Web Audio graph with master/music/SFX/crowd/UI buses and a compressor. Synthesized UI sounds, a title sting, and a coastal ambience (surf, wind, crowd murmur). Muted when unfocused (setting).
- **Perf tools:**
  - **Settings → Display → FPS counter.**
  - **The hidden perf screen:** press ` (backquote) or open with `?perf`. It shows the frame-time graph, avg/p95/p99/min/max, draw calls, triangles, geometries, textures, shader programs, JS heap (Chromium), canvas and internal resolution, quality tier, lighting, GPU string and browser, plus a "Copy report" button.
- **Quality:** first launch picks Low/Medium/High/Ultra from the GPU name. The in-scene benchmark that refines it comes in milestone 3.
- **Skin tones:** everyone starts at the legacy default tone. The editor saves to `data/characterization.json` in the repo:
  - in `npm run dev`, directly;
  - on a deployment, through `api/characterization.ts`, which commits via the GitHub API once `EDITOR_KEY` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are set in Vercel.

**Tests:** 63 unit tests (data drift, validation, legacy differential, detmath, RNG, sub package, grades, input map, characterization schema, quality guess) and 5 Playwright browser tests:
- intro → title → menu → settings → FPS counter → perf screen → back;
- locked modes toast instead of opening a stand-in screen;
- rebinding moves a clashing key and persists;
- the skin-tone editor opens from Settings and edits;
- phones get the gate.

**Settings wired now vs. later.** Every setting is stored and survives reloads. These take effect now: fullscreen, resolution scale, frame cap, FOV, FPS counter, quality preset, shadows, AO, anti-aliasing, bloom, vignette, all audio sliders, mute when unfocused, lighting, skip intros, interface scale, reduce flashing (bloom), and every binding. The rest act on systems that don't exist yet and switch on as they land: dynamic resolution, HUD scale and safe area (M3/M6), crowd density and grass detail (M3), replay DOF and motion blur (M7), weather particles (M3), difficulty, game length, camera, auto-replay, colorblind icons, captions, shake, hold-to-toggle (M5–M8).

__CRITIQUE__

**Next (M2 Ratings, then M3 The look in parallel while you review ratings):** validation → `corrections.json`, nflverse-sourced augmentation (now reachable), era baselines, the attribute set with contributions, OVR, traits, Ratings Explorer, validation suite, `RATINGS_REPORT.md`. Then stop for your ratings review.

**Known issues**

- Performance numbers from this container are meaningless (no GPU; Chromium renders through SwiftShader at a few frames per second). Frame rate on your Mac is the real check.
- The main JS bundle is 618 KB gzipped (three.js, R3F and all player data). Under the 1.5 MB boot budget; code-splitting the editor and dev pages comes later.
- `THREE.Clock` deprecation warnings in the console come from React Three Fiber internals, not our code.
